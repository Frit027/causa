# About The Project
"Causa" is designed to manage tasks, employees and finances of a business project. The user can create new employees, add information about them and change it. There is a possibility of dismissal of an employee. He can be returned to work at any time.

The site makes it possible to create tasks, assign each of them a person responsible for its implementation, deadline, priority and add a short description to it. At any time, you can complete the task and, if you wish, reward the employee who completed it.

The user can set the budget for his company for the current month and change it if necessary.
